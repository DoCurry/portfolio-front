  "about": "A tech enthusiast driven by the thrill of building and innovating. With a solid grounding in full-stack development and hands-on experience across multiple tech stacks, my journey began with a fascination for crafting responsive, user-centric web applications. Over the years, this has blossomed into a broader passion for automation, data analytics, and scalable design. My approach blends curiosity with purpose: I'm always eager to dive into new frameworks, tackle complex problems, and translate ideas into solutions that create value. Whether I'm visualizing insights, optimizing workflows, or building end-to-end systems, I thrive on pushing boundaries and staying at the frontier of technology.",
